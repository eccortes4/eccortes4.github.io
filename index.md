### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites. While working on this part of lab i ran into an issue with the unit test where the aces weren't being assigned the right value. It took some critical thinking to finally come up with the solution which was really rewarding and showed me what it means to be a programmer.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was really enjoyable to work on since it involved solving a real world problem, reading parking signs. Also the amount of if statements and logic used in the code showed me the importance of paying attention to small details. This lab really allowed me to master some of the fundamental concepts in C++.
* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 is an unexpected favorite of mine. The lab itself is quite simple but a great demosntration of the importance of testing your code. While working on this lab it took multiple rounds of close examination to realize and make the correct edits to get the units to convert properly.
